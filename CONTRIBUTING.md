# Open Source at K-State Guidelines

Please follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kansas-state-university/Welcome/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.

## Contributing to Open Source Projects

The best part about open source projects is that anyone can work on them! For small fixes and updates, go ahead and submit a pull request. If you have a large amount of changes or additions, open an issue stating what you want to do. This helps make sure that your PR will be accepted.


## Opening or Replying to an Issue

Issues serve many functions. Here's some things you could open an issue for:

* To discuss a topic of interest with others.
* To ask for advice about how to take the next step with the skills you've learnt.
* To give feedback.
* Bug reporting.
* To suggest a new feature.
